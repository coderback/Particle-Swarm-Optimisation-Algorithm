# Particle-Swarm-Optimisation-Algorithm with PySwarms

This repository contains Python code for implementing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) using the PySwarms library. PSO is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the PSO algorithm on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
